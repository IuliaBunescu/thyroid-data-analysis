TSH,Thyroid Stimulating Hormone,mIU/L,0.4,4.0,Possible hyperthyroidism (under-suppressed TSH),Possible hypothyroidism (elevated TSH),https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroid-stimulating_hormone,TSH rises when thyroid function is low and falls when thyroid function is high.
T3,Triiodothyronine,pg/mL,2.0,4.4,Low T3 – hypothyroidism or non-thyroidal illness,High T3 – hyperthyroidism,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triiodothyronine,T3 reflects metabolic activity — high in overactive thyroid and low in underactive or sick states.
TT4,Thyroxine,µg/dL,60.0,150.0,Low TT4 – hypothyroidism,High TT4 – hyperthyroidism,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroxine,"Measures overall thyroid hormone production — high means overactive thyroid, low means underactive."
T4U,Thyroxine Binding Ratio,fraction (unitless),0.8,1.3,"Low T4U – increased TBG, possible hypothyroidism","High T4U – decreased TBG, possible hyperthyroidism",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroxine-binding_globulin,"Indicates thyroid-binding protein activity — low in hypothyroidism, high in hyperthyroidism."
FTI,Free Thyroxine Index,index units,53.0,142.0,Low FTI – hypothyroidism,High FTI – hyperthyroidism,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_thyroxine_index,"Reflects true thyroid hormone activity — high in hyperthyroidism, low in hypothyroidism."
TBG,Thyroxine Binding Globulin,µg/mL,13.0,30.0,"Low TBG – decreased binding capacity, possible protein deficiency","High TBG – increased binding capacity, possible estrogen effect or liver disease",https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thyroxine-binding_globulin,Affects total thyroid hormone levels — doesn’t change actual thyroid function.
